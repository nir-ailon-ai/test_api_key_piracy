The purpose of the repo was to check how fast an open-ai key visible on a public repo would be stolen by pirates.
Result of experiment: After less than one minute of posting this repo, and after explicitly allowing posting secret keys on github settings,  OpenAI sent me an email updating me that my API KEY has been compromised and disabled.
